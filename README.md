# Introduction

Travel Guide is a Web Application developed as a Design Engineering Project which helps users by suggesting famous and worth visiting places nearby them. Along with Locations, It also provides brief information about the places. This web app serves the information based on the user location. Route is fetched using Google Maps API. It provides information about the place such as its name, location, reviews, ratings, and how far it is from the user's live location.

## Build Info

It is purely built in **ReactJS** with the help of [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/). It uses [@vis.gl/react-google-maps](https://visgl.github.io/react-google-maps/) for handling all the Map functionality. The places are fetched using [Travel Advisor](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/Travel%20Advisor) APIs in realtime.
